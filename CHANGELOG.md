## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

  - Support for the HTTP Retry-After header in the default retry logic. If a server responds with a Retry-After header (in seconds or as a date), ffetch will honor it and use the specified delay before retrying.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 22f70cd: Added
  - Support for modern AbortSignal.timeout and AbortSignal.any APIs (requires polyfill for Node <20 and older browsers).
  - cause property to all custom error classes for better error provenance.

  Changed
  - Refactored timeout and abort logic to use only AbortSignal APIs; removed manual timeout fallback.
  - Tests now strictly assert error types and .cause properties.
  - Improved test coverage for edge cases and fallback branches.

  Docs
  - Updated README with new prerequisites, error .cause documentation, and polyfill instructions.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add core resilience features:
  - **Timeouts:** Requests are aborted if they exceed a configurable timeout.

  - **Circuit Breaker:** Automatically blocks requests after repeated failures, with auto-reset after cooldown.
  - **Hooks:** New lifecycle hooks for before, after, onError, onRetry, onTimeout, onAbort, onCircuitOpen, and onComplete, enabling advanced logging, metrics, and custom behaviors.
